### Would you be able to explain Object-oriented JavaScript and give examples?
<pre>Technically everything in JavaScript is an Object. Using objects, classes, or constructor functions you can create reusable objects. It encapulates data so you write less code.

When creating a new component you extend React.Component, which allows you to use functionality that the React team has built in.</pre>
